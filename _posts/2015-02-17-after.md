Do something after a resource is read from the database. The callback function has two optional parameters, the request and response objects, respectively. It may return either the resource or a promise. Here's a contrived example that hides a password and salt from being exposed:

```
app.after('user', function () {
  delete this.password;
  delete this.salt;
  return this;
});
```

####Parameters

- name (String): may be space separated, i.e. 'cat dog human'
- fn (Function): this callback function is called within the context of the resource, and has two optional parameters: the request and response objects, respectively.
