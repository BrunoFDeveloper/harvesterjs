Do something before a resource is saved in the database. The callback function has two optional parameters, the request and response objects, respectively. It may return either the resource or a promise. Here's a contrived example that stores the Authorization header into a user:

```
app.before('user', function (request, response) {
  var authorization = request.get('Authorization');
  if (!authorization) throw new Error('Authorization failed');
  this.authorization = authorization;
  return this;
});
```

####Parameters

- name (String): may be space separated, i.e. 'cat dog human'
- fn (Function): this callback function is called within the context of the resource, and has two optional parameters: the request and response objects, respectively.
