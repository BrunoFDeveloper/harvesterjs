```
adapter.findMany(model, [query], [limit], [skip], [sort], [fields]) â†’ Promise
```

####Parameters
- model (String | Object): if the model is a string, it looks up the model based it's name
- \[query\] (Array | Object): if the query is a string, then it is assumed that it's the ID

- \[skip\] (Number): return the results after a certain number of found resources. Default: 0
- \[sort\] (Object): specify the order in which resources come back. -1 means decending, 1 means ascending. The order of keys in this object matters. Default: {"id"=-1}.
- \[fields\] (String): specify which fields should be included in returning resources. Space delimited.
