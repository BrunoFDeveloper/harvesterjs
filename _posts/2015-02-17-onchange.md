Provides access to mongodb oplog events. Requires a bit of application setup; see [the recipe](https://github.com/agco/agco-nodejs-recipes/wiki/Reliable-event-processing-using-the-oplog).

```
Harvester.resource('post', {
                 title: String
             })
             .onChange({
                       update:updateFn,
                       delete:deleteFn,
                       insert:insertFn
                   })
```

Provided functions will be called with a sole parameter: the id of the resource that has changed.

####Parameters
- callbacks (Object), takes one, more or none of 'update','delete','insert' keys, with functions as values.
