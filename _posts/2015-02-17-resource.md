Define a resource and setup routes simultaneously. A schema field may be either a native type, a plain object, or a string that refers to a related resource.

```
Harvester.resource(name, schema, options) *chainable
```

Valid native types: String, Number, Boolean, Date, Array, Buffer

Alternatively, the object format must be as follows:

```
{type: String} // no association
{ref: 'relatedResource', inverse: 'relatedKey'} // "belongs to" association to "relatedKey" key on "relatedResource"
[{ref: 'anotherResource', inverse: 'someKey'}] // "has many" association to "someKey" on "anotherResource"
[{ref: 'anotherResource', inverse: null}] // "has many" one-way association to "anotherResource"
```

####Parameters

- name (String): the name of the resource
- schema (Object): the schema object to add
- options (Object): additional options to pass to the schema
