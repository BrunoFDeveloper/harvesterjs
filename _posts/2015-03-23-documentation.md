Harvester.js documentation is hosted on GitHub pages and is handled by Jekyll. 
This page contains guidelines on document writing (the why, the what and the how).

## Why

Harvester.js has been created with broad adoption in mind. There's no point in making
an API great (and it is great) and failing to help people learn how to use it.

## What

Every non-evident feature in harvester.js should be documented. Even evident ones 
should be considered, as people who are new to the stack might have a different
perception of what is evident.

## How
