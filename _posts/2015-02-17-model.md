**private**
 Returns the model of the underlying adapter's ORM. This is currently implemented in mongodb's adapter, but is not part of the adapter spec.


If you find yourself using the model, please submit either a pull request with your requested functionality or submit a ticket on github's issues so we can plan to deliver the functionality you want.

```
adapter.model(modelName, [schema]) â†’ Model
```

####Parameters
- modelName (String | Object): name of the harvester model.
- schema ( Object): harvester schema. **NB If schema is provided, this method changes from a getter to a setter, and it will generate a new model based on the schema input and update the old model.**
